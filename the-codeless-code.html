            <h1>The Codeless Code</h1>
            <h2>Ordinary code is the way</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>When the 'client' makes a request, we must parse it</p>
        <p>We take that information and try to make sense out of it</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Perphaps the client needs a solution to a common problem, or a bug
          fixed
        </p>
        <p>
          Our job, as the 'server' is to handle that request and return to them
          a suitable response
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But before we write any code, lets just begin by asking a preliminary
          question...
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Do we even need to write code?</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Code does not always have to be written in progamming languages</h3>
        <p>
          Before even considering a solution, you should be absolutely certain
          what the problem is
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding a way to verify and document the issue is a good way to begin
          your dialogue with the client
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Already, through the process of documentation we begin to write the
          'codeless code'
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be taking notes, sending emails, writing reports, presenting
          your discoveries!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Gaining a full understanding of the issue and being able to explain
          the process is gold
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-written document, a tangible token. This response is better
          than only giving a verbal explanation
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>There may be 'nothing' to do</h3>
        <p>The first possibility is that the client could be mistaken</p>
        <p>
          While it may be easier to just give the client what they asked for, we
          want to provide real value
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Especially when dealing with non-devs, there is often a
          misunderstanding of a technical problem
        </p>
        <p>
          You may discover that there was actually nothing to solve to begin
          with
        </p>
        <p>Great!</p>
        <br />
        <p>However this does not mean that you haven't done anything</p>
        <p>
          You will have provided insight which helps to enlighten the client to
          a new understanding
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>A non-code solution</h3>
        <p>Writing and maintaining new code can be a lot of effort and cost</p>
        <p>
          Can we find an existing solution, or one that takes less resources?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As I was told as a child "Just because you can, that doesn't mean you
          should"
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than creating a custom product, there may be one that can be
          quickly employed
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding a sustainable and reliable solution, may be a simple query
          search away
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As they often say in programming culture, "There is no need to
          reinvent the wheel"
        </p>
        <p>
          Building something completely new should be a last resort unless its
          for personal development
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>A thousand ways to approach writing code</h3>
        <p>
          Once a decision has been made to build it, we have to find the right
          tools for the job
        </p>
        <p>
          The more tools we have, the more complicated the situation becomes
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Complexity is the mother of all bugs</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Are the tools reputable? The languages, the packages, the
          architecture, etc.
        </p>
        <p>For how long can this piece of software be easily maintained?</p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, even after one month, you find your dependencies have all
          been deprecated
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Ordinary code is maintainable code</h3>
        <p>
          One of my favorite design principles has been "Keep it simple stupid"
          KISS
        </p>
        <p>
          By writing idiomatic code, and upholding common practice, you become
          the superior programmer
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Trust your intuition when it feels like you may be headed into the
          weeds
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost every common task has already been solved in a concise manner
        </p>
        <p>
          To attain this sublime practice, you must completely cut off the way
          of cleverness
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Knowing when to say NO</h3>
        <p>
          You may be dealing with a stubborn client, or an unmaintainable legacy
          code base
        </p>
        <p>Know your limits!</p>
        <p>
          Before moving forward, take some time to evaluate instead of rushing
          into an agreement
        </p>
        <p>
          Saying no to this opportunity may free your time for something better
        </p>
        <p>Or it may just give you peace of mind, which is priceless</p>
