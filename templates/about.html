          Hi, I'm Julian Ranieri. I'm an independent software contractor based
          in the San Francisco Bay Area. Since 2020, I've been working on
          full-stack web services that interact with relational databases and
          various APIs. I also develop small mobile or desktop applications as
          well as command-line tools that cater to specific client requirements.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In my role as a developer, I focus on solving problems efficiently and
          securely, always mindful of best practices for web-based services. As
          a consultant, I carefully consider the cost-benefit aspects of
          technological solutions to ensure that my advice leads to maintainable
          and successful products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My professional experience includes collaborating on projects ranging
          from optimizing web application performance to designing software for
          real-time interaction and data management. Whether I'm improving load
          capacities or developing new software functionalities, my aim is to
          deliver reliable and effective solutions.
        </p>
