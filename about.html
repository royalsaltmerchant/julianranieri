        <p>
          I'm a full-stack software developer with 5+ years of hands-on experience building lean, reliable systems from the ground up. I've worked across web, desktop, and server applications, often solo or on small teams where clear thinking, adaptability, and delivering working code fast were key.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm fluent in <strong>JavaScript, Go, Python, and C</strong>, and I've built everything from real-time chat systems to GUI tools to audio processing pipelines. I value clean architecture, performance, and simplicity, especially in early-stage products where every line of code should pull its weight.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Check out some of my <a href="software.html">side projects</a> to see what I build in my spare time.
