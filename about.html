        <p>
          I'm a software developer and systems-oriented engineer with 5+ years of experience diagnosing performance, security, and scalability issues and delivering durable solutions. I've worked across backend systems, real-time communication, infrastructure, and frontend applications, often solo or on small teams where clear thinking, strong judgment, and delivering working code fast were essential.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm fluent in <strong>JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, C, and C++</strong>, and I've built everything from real-time chat systems with WebRTC to infrastructure automation with Terraform to GUI tools and audio processing pipelines. I value clean architecture, performance, and simplicity—balancing user experience, system constraints, and long-term maintainability.
